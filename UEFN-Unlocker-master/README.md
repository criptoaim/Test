# UEFN Unlocker

This DLL allows you to open and duplicate any type of asset (including cooked and generated class assets) in UEFN, regardless of whether or not you use the [No Valkyrie Plugin Pak](https://twitter.com/gamerbross_/status/1652772955535859718).

Shout out to [Jko](https://twitter.com/jko_master) for helping me to debug the DLL on old versions to test its compatibility :)

# Usage

## Downloading the precompiled Artifact

You must be logged in Github, go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/gamerbross/UEFN-Unlocker/actions), select the latest workflow (item), if you scroll down you should find `UEFN Unlocker` inside the `Artifacts` category, click it and it will start downloading.

## Injecting the DLL

There are a lot of ways to inject a DLL into a program, for example [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) (the one that I use), [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org), etc... Just search a tutorial in the internet.
